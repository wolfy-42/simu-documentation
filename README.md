SIMU is a simulation framework for HDL and ultimately FPGA development. 

Hardware Description Language (HDL) simulation is a specific task requiring many tools to work together and usually everyone developing an FPGA is developing a custom simulation environment. This is not very efficient and over time it becomes quite tedious. For this reason the simu framework was developed, with the added flexibility to support different simulation tool vendors and different FPGA vendors. In a custom environment it is not often the case to have the ability to support different simulators and FPGA vendors. 

Why is SIMU so good:

- short setup time and learning curve, because we don't like wasting time
- sticking to simple language constructs for fast ramp-up 
- promote all good practices in the field of verification - regression, randomization, scalability, coverage, etc.
- flexible scripting structure to switch quickly between different OS, HDL languages and simulation tool vendors
