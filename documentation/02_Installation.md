# Installation

Copy 'symphony/dev/sim' folder to your project simulation folder. 

That is all it take to have the SIMU framework installed. The 'sim' folder contains all scripts and libraries you will need to run HDL simulations.

Besides the SIMU framework, you will need the HDL simulator tool and the licenses it requires.

A list of the needed relevant HDL simulating tools can be found here - [HDL Simulators Supported][HDL Simulators Supported]
